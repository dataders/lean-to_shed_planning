### Claude:
I executed the primary workflow to plan your DIY lean-to roof construction project, following the CLAUDE.md instructions:

1. **Read inputs/outputs directories**: Analyzed spec_v0.md and spec_v1.md requirements, backed up existing outputs/ to archive/v1-20250830-141101/

2. **Created comprehensive construction plan** with four detailed documents:
   - `comprehensive-plan.md` - Complete project overview with structural calculations, materials, and 5-phase installation sequence
   - `materials-list.md` - Detailed materials with quantities and $669-$939 cost estimate
   - `installation-steps.md` - Step-by-step construction guide with safety protocols
   - `calculations.md` - Engineering calculations showing sistered 2x10 beam requirement

3. **Key findings**:
   - Rafter length: 8' 2x6s (calculated 7.09' actual need)
   - Beam sizing: Two 2x10s bolted together required for 16' span
   - Bird's mouth cuts: 1.5" x 3.5" for proper beam seating
   - All connections meet code requirements with adequate safety margins

4. **Updated workflow tracking**: Created and maintained `workflow-todos.md` documenting all completed tasks and accomplishments

5. **Executed Workflow Improvement Protocol**: Enhanced CLAUDE.md troubleshooting section with lessons learned about structural calculations, cost estimation, installation details, and materials specifications
