# Lean-To Roof Installation Steps

## Pre-Construction Checklist
- [ ] Obtain building permits if required
- [ ] Call 811 for utility locates
- [ ] Verify concrete piers are level and properly cured
- [ ] Gather all tools and materials
- [ ] Check weather forecast (avoid high winds/rain)

## Phase 1: Ledger Board Installation

### Step 1.1: Mark Ledger Location
- [ ] Measure 7.5' from ground and mark level line on shed wall
- [ ] Use chalk line to ensure straight ledger placement
- [ ] Check wall for studs using stud finder
- [ ] Mark stud locations every 16" for bolt placement

### Step 1.2: Drill Ledger Holes
- [ ] Clamp ledger board in position at marked line
- [ ] Drill pilot holes through ledger and into wall studs
- [ ] Use 1/2" drill bit for lag bolt holes
- [ ] Counterbore holes slightly for washer seating

### Step 1.3: Install Ledger Board
- [ ] Apply construction adhesive to back of ledger
- [ ] Position ledger and install 1/2" x 6" lag bolts with washers
- [ ] Tighten bolts snug but don't over-tighten
- [ ] Check ledger for level along entire length

### Step 1.4: Install Flashing
- [ ] Cut step flashing to length
- [ ] Install flashing above ledger board
- [ ] Seal flashing with appropriate caulk
- [ ] Ensure water will shed away from building

## Phase 2: Post and Beam Assembly

### Step 2.1: Prepare Posts
- [ ] Measure from concrete pier to final beam height
- [ ] Account for beam thickness (actual 2x10 = 1.5" x 9.25")
- [ ] Cut 4x4 posts to calculated length
- [ ] Sand cut ends smooth

### Step 2.2: Install Posts
- [ ] Attach Simpson Strong-Tie brackets to concrete piers
- [ ] Set posts in brackets and check for plumb
- [ ] Temporarily brace posts with 2x4 bracing
- [ ] Secure posts in brackets per manufacturer specs

### Step 2.3: Install Beam
- [ ] If using sistered 2x10s, bolt together with 1/2" carriage bolts
- [ ] Mark beam for post locations (8' spacing)
- [ ] Set beam on posts with helper or lifting equipment
- [ ] Check beam for level and adjust posts if needed
- [ ] Drill holes and secure beam to posts with carriage bolts

## Phase 3: Rafter Installation

### Step 3.1: Cut First Rafter (Template)
- [ ] Cut 2x6 to 8' length
- [ ] Mark and cut bird's mouth: 1.5" horizontal x 3.5" vertical
- [ ] Test fit rafter between ledger and beam
- [ ] Adjust cuts until fit is perfect
- [ ] Mark rafter end cuts for proper overhang

### Step 3.2: Install Rafter Hangers
- [ ] Mark hanger locations on ledger at 24" OC
- [ ] Install 2x6 joist hangers with proper nails
- [ ] Ensure hangers are level and properly aligned
- [ ] Double-check spacing measurements

### Step 3.3: Cut Remaining Rafters
- [ ] Use template rafter to mark remaining 8 rafters
- [ ] Cut all rafters to identical dimensions
- [ ] Test fit 2-3 rafters before cutting all
- [ ] Stack cut rafters to prevent warping

### Step 3.4: Install Rafters
- [ ] Start with end rafters and work toward center
- [ ] Set rafters in hangers at ledger board
- [ ] Secure bird's mouth to beam with 2 - 16d nails
- [ ] Check each rafter for proper seating
- [ ] Install blocking between rafters if required by code

## Phase 4: Purline Installation

### Step 4.1: Layout Purline Locations
- [ ] Mark purline locations 24" OC across all rafters
- [ ] Start from eave and work toward ledger
- [ ] Use chalk line to ensure straight installation
- [ ] Double-check spacing for roofing panel requirements

### Step 4.2: Cut and Install Purlines
- [ ] Cut 2x4 purlines to 16' length
- [ ] Install perpendicular to rafters at marked locations
- [ ] Use 2.5" galvanized screws, 2 per rafter
- [ ] Check purlines for straight alignment

## Phase 5: Roofing Installation

### Step 5.1: Install Underlayment
- [ ] Roll synthetic underlayment starting at eave
- [ ] Overlap seams by 6" minimum
- [ ] Staple every 12" along rafters
- [ ] Extend underlayment 1" beyond fascia

### Step 5.2: Install Drip Edge
- [ ] Install D-style drip edge at eave over underlayment
- [ ] Install L-style trim at ledger under underlayment
- [ ] Overlap joints by 2" minimum
- [ ] Secure with roofing nails every 12"

### Step 5.3: Install Metal Panels
- [ ] Start with full panel at one end
- [ ] Ensure proper overhang (6" at eave, flush at sides)
- [ ] Use self-drilling screws in flat areas of panels
- [ ] Overlap panels per manufacturer specifications
- [ ] Install closure strips at eave and ridge

### Step 5.4: Final Trim and Sealing
- [ ] Install remaining trim pieces
- [ ] Caulk all penetrations and joints
- [ ] Apply roofing sealant under panel laps
- [ ] Install gutter system if planned

## Quality Control Checkpoints

### During Installation
- [ ] Check measurements twice before cutting
- [ ] Verify square and level at each major step
- [ ] Test fit components before final installation
- [ ] Use proper fasteners for each application

### Final Inspection
- [ ] Walk entire roof perimeter checking for gaps
- [ ] Verify all fasteners are tight and sealed
- [ ] Check drainage flow during first rain
- [ ] Remove all construction debris

## Safety Reminders
- Use fall protection when working above 6 feet
- Have helper for lifting beam and rafters
- Check ladder placement and condition
- Wear safety glasses when cutting or drilling
- Use proper lifting techniques for heavy materials

## Weather Considerations
- **Ideal Conditions**: Dry, calm weather 45-75Â°F
- **Avoid**: High winds (15+ mph), rain, extreme heat/cold
- **Seasonal**: Spring/summer best for metal roofing work
- **Schedule**: Allow 2-3 full days for complete installation

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Ledger Not Level
- Use shims between ledger and wall
- Check wall for bow or irregularities
- Consider scribing ledger to match wall

### Posts Not Plumb
- Adjust concrete pier height with non-shrink grout
- Use adjustable post bases if available
- Ensure adequate temporary bracing

### Rafter Fit Issues
- Double-check measurements and calculations
- Verify beam is level and straight
- Adjust bird's mouth cuts as needed

### Panel Installation Problems
- Pre-drill holes to prevent panel distortion
- Use proper closure strips for panel profile
- Don't over-tighten fasteners
