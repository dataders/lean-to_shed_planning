## Shopping Tips

### Lumber Yard Considerations
- Buy lumber in single trip to ensure consistent grade/moisture
- Check for crown/bow in dimensional lumber
- Consider pressure-treated lumber for posts in ground contact
- Ask about delivery for long materials

### Hardware Store Strategy
- Buy galvanized/stainless fasteners for longevity
- Purchase 10% extra fasteners for waste/mistakes
- Consider fastener variety packs for mixed projects
- Check local building code requirements

### Roofing Supplier Notes
- Order panels 6" longer than calculated (17' for 16.5' need)
- Match existing building colors if desired
- Confirm panel profile compatibility with closure strips
- Ask about cut-to-length services

## Seasonal Considerations
- **Spring/Summer**: Higher material costs, better availability
- **Fall/Winter**: Potential discounts, limited installation weather
- **Bulk Purchases**: Consider combining with other projects

## Quality Upgrades
- **Premium Option**: Upgrade to 2x12 beam for extra capacity (+$40)
- **Longevity**: Use stainless steel fasteners (+$50-75)
- **Aesthetics**: Color-matched trim and panels (+$25-50)
- **Insulation**: Add rigid foam under metal (+$75-100)
