# Lean-To Roof Construction Plan

## Project Overview
Building a 16' long lean-to roof attached to an existing shed with corrugated steel roofing, 2:12 pitch, and 6.5' horizontal run.

## Key Specifications
- **Roof Length**: 16 feet
- **Run (horizontal projection)**: 6.5 feet  
- **Pitch**: 2:12 (2" rise per 12" run)
- **Ledger Height**: 7.5 feet above ground
- **Overhang**: 6" past beam, no side overhangs
- **Rafter Spacing**: 24" on center (9 rafters total)
- **Support**: 3 posts at 8' spacing on concrete piers

## Structural Calculations

### Rafter Calculations
- **Run**: 6.5 feet = 78 inches
- **Rise**: 78" × (2/12) = 13 inches
- **Rafter Length**: √(78² + 13²) = √(6084 + 169) = √6253 = 79.08" = 6.59 feet
- **Total Rafter Length** (with overhangs): 6.59' + 0.5' = 7.09' → **8' 2x6 rafters**

### Beam Sizing
For 16' span with rafters 24" OC supporting corrugated steel:
- **Recommended**: 2x10 or 2x12 beam
- **Dead Load**: ~15 psf (roofing + framing)
- **Live Load**: 20 psf minimum
- **Snow Load**: Check local requirements

### Height Calculations
- **Ledger Height**: 7.5 feet
- **Beam Height**: 7.5' - 13" = 6.42 feet above ground
- **Post Height**: 6.42' + beam thickness = ~6.5' above concrete

## Materials List

### Lumber (Modified for 12' Transport Limit)
- **Rafters**: 9 pieces 2x6x8' ✓ *Fits hatchback*
- **Beam**: 2 pieces 2x10x12' (sistered) ✓ *Fits hatchback*
- **Ledger Board**: 2 pieces 2x8x8' (joined with splice) ✓ *Fits hatchback*
- **Purlines**: 16 pieces 2x4x8' (field-joined) ✓ *Fits hatchback*
- **Posts**: 3 pieces 4x4x8' ✓ *Fits hatchback*

**⚠️ Transport Solution**: All lumber sized for hatchback capacity. Beam and ledger require field assembly.

### Hardware (Torx Fasteners Preferred)
- **Rafter Hangers**: 9 pieces 2x6 joist hangers
- **Ledger Bolts**: 1/2" x 6" lag bolts, 16" OC
- [x] **Post Brackets**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Simpson Strong-Tie brackets installed in piers
- **Torx Screws**: Preferred throughout project for superior grip
- **Carriage Bolts**: 1/2" x 8" for beam-to-post connections
- **Splice Hardware**: For joining 12' beam sections and 8' ledger sections

### Roofing Materials  
- **Steel Panels**: Corrugated steel, 16' length + 6" overhang = 17' panels
- **Ridge/Eave Trim**: L-style at ledger, D-style at eave
- **Underlayment**: Synthetic roofing underlayment, 200 sq ft
- **Fasteners**: Self-drilling Torx screws for steel roofing
- **Sealants/Caulk**: For weather sealing

## Installation Sequence

### Phase 1: Ledger Installation (3-4 hours)
1. **Join ledger sections**: Splice two 8' 2x8s with construction adhesive and Torx screws
2. Mark ledger location on shed wall at 7.5' height
3. Locate wall studs and mark bolt locations 16" OC
4. Drill pilot holes and install 1/2" lag bolts
5. Install flashing above ledger board
6. Attach rafter hangers to ledger, 24" OC

### Phase 2: Post and Beam Installation (4-5 hours)
1. [x] ✅ **COMPLETED**: Concrete piers poured and Simpson brackets installed
2. **Address pier alignment**: Check for plumb, use shims if needed
3. Cut 4x4 posts to final height (measure from concrete)
4. Set posts in existing brackets and check for plumb
5. **Assemble sistered beam**: Join two 12' 2x10s with carriage bolts
6. Set beam on posts and check for level (account for pier variations)
7. Secure beam to posts with Torx lag bolts
8. Install post bracing if required

### Phase 3: Rafter Installation (4-6 hours)
1. **Tool consideration**: Upgraded miter saw recommended for precision
2. Cut bird's mouth notches in rafters (1.5" x 3.5" for 2x beam)
3. **Account for variations**: Measure each rafter location due to potential pier misalignment
4. Test fit first rafter and use as template
5. Install rafters in hangers at ledger
6. Secure rafters to beam with Torx structural screws
7. Install blocking between rafters if required

### Phase 4: Purline Installation (2-3 hours)
1. Mark purline locations 24" OC across rafters
2. **Modified for transport**: Join 8' 2x4 sections at rafter intersections
3. Install 2x4 purlines perpendicular to rafters
4. Use 2.5" Torx exterior screws for attachment
5. Check spacing for roofing panel layout

### Phase 5: Roofing Installation (6-8 hours)
1. Install synthetic underlayment starting at eave
2. Install D-style drip edge at eave
3. Install corrugated steel panels from bottom up
4. **Use DeWalt Impact Driver**: Ideal for Torx roofing screws
5. Overlap panels per manufacturer specs
6. Install L-style trim at ledger connection
7. Seal all penetrations and joints

## Critical Notes

### Project-Specific Considerations
- [x] ✅ **Foundation Work**: Concrete piers and brackets completed
- ⚠️ **Pier Alignment**: Expect minor misalignment, plan corrections
- **Transport**: All materials sized for 12' hatchback capacity
- **Fasteners**: Torx screws specified throughout for better performance
- **Retail**: Lowe's preferred, Home Depot as backup

### Standard Requirements
- **Building Permits**: Check local requirements before starting
- **Attachment Method**: Verify shed wall can support ledger loads
- **Flashing**: Proper flashing at ledger is critical for water protection
- **Post Foundation**: Piers already installed below frost line
- **Beam Size**: Confirm sistered 2x10 sizing with local building codes

## Tools Assessment

- Speed square
- Chalk line
- Socket wrenches
- Safety equipment (glasses, gloves, fall protection)

### Recommended Tool Upgrades
