# Lean-To Roof Installation Steps

## Pre-Construction Checklist
- [ ] Obtain building permits if required
- [ ] Call 811 for utility locates
- [x] ✅ **COMPLETED**: Concrete piers dug, poured, and cured
- [x] ✅ **COMPLETED**: 4x4 Simpson Strong-Tie brackets installed in piers
- [ ] ⚠️ **Check pier alignment** - May not be perfectly plumb, plan adjustments
- [ ] Gather all tools and materials
- [ ] Check weather forecast (avoid high winds/rain)
- [ ] **Tool Assessment**: Evaluate miter saw accuracy needs

## Phase 1: Ledger Board Installation
**⏱️ Estimated Time: 3-4 hours**

### Step 1.1: Mark Ledger Location
- [ ] Measure 7.5' from ground and mark level line on shed wall
- [ ] Use chalk line to ensure straight ledger placement
- [ ] Check wall for studs using stud finder
- [ ] Mark stud locations every 16" for bolt placement

### Step 1.2: Prepare Ledger Board
- [ ] **For transport accommodation**: Join two 8' 2x8s with splice plate
- [ ] Position splice joint away from critical load points
- [ ] Use construction adhesive and Torx screws for splice
- [ ] Clamp assembled ledger in position at marked line
- [ ] Drill pilot holes through ledger and into wall studs
- [ ] Use 1/2" drill bit for lag bolt holes
- [ ] Counterbore holes slightly for washer seating

### Step 1.3: Install Ledger Board
- [ ] Apply construction adhesive to back of ledger
- [ ] Position ledger and install 1/2" x 6" lag bolts with washers
- [ ] Tighten bolts snug but don't over-tighten
- [ ] Check ledger for level along entire length

### Step 1.4: Install Flashing
- [ ] Cut step flashing to length
- [ ] Install flashing above ledger board
- [ ] Seal flashing with appropriate caulk
- [ ] Ensure water will shed away from building

## Phase 2: Post and Beam Assembly
**⏱️ Estimated Time: 4-5 hours**

### Step 2.1: Prepare Posts
- [ ] Measure from concrete pier to final beam height
- [ ] Account for beam thickness (actual 2x10 = 1.5" x 9.25")
- [ ] Cut 4x4 posts to calculated length
- [ ] Sand cut ends smooth

### Step 2.2: Install Posts (Address Pier Alignment)
- [x] ✅ **COMPLETED**: Simpson Strong-Tie brackets already installed in piers
- [ ] **Check pier alignment**: Use string line to verify post positions
- [ ] **If piers not plumb**: Use shims or adjustable brackets to correct
- [ ] Set posts in brackets and check for plumb individually
- [ ] **Critical**: Measure diagonals to ensure square layout
- [ ] Temporarily brace posts with 2x4 bracing
- [ ] Secure posts in brackets per manufacturer specs

### Step 2.3: Install Beam (Modified for Transport)
- [ ] **Sister beam assembly**: Join two 12' 2x10s with carriage bolts
- [ ] Stagger bolt pattern every 16" along beam length
- [ ] Use construction adhesive between sistered members
- [ ] Mark beam for post locations (8' spacing)  
- [ ] Set beam on posts with helper or lifting equipment
- [ ] **Account for pier misalignment**: Adjust beam level with shims if needed
- [ ] Check beam for level and adjust posts if needed
- [ ] Drill holes and secure beam to posts with Torx lag bolts

## Phase 3: Rafter Installation
**⏱️ Estimated Time: 4-6 hours**

### Step 3.1: Cut First Rafter (Template)
- [ ] **Tool consideration**: Use upgraded miter saw for precision cuts
- [ ] Cut 2x6 to 8' length
- [ ] Mark and cut bird's mouth: 1.5" horizontal x 3.5" vertical  
- [ ] **Account for beam variations**: Measure each post location individually
- [ ] Test fit rafter between ledger and beam
- [ ] Adjust cuts until fit is perfect
- [ ] Mark rafter end cuts for proper overhang

### Step 3.2: Install Rafter Hangers
- [ ] Mark hanger locations on ledger at 24" OC
- [ ] Install 2x6 joist hangers with proper nails
- [ ] Ensure hangers are level and properly aligned
- [ ] Double-check spacing measurements

### Step 3.3: Cut Remaining Rafters
- [ ] Use template rafter to mark remaining 8 rafters
- [ ] Cut all rafters to identical dimensions
- [ ] Test fit 2-3 rafters before cutting all
- [ ] Stack cut rafters to prevent warping

### Step 3.4: Install Rafters
- [ ] Start with end rafters and work toward center
- [ ] Set rafters in hangers at ledger board
- [ ] Secure bird's mouth to beam with Torx structural screws
- [ ] **Check for pier-induced variations**: Adjust individual rafter fits
- [ ] Check each rafter for proper seating
- [ ] Install blocking between rafters if required by code

## Phase 4: Purline Installation
**⏱️ Estimated Time: 2-3 hours**

### Step 4.1: Layout Purline Locations
- [ ] Mark purline locations 24" OC across all rafters
- [ ] Start from eave and work toward ledger
- [ ] Use chalk line to ensure straight installation
- [ ] Double-check spacing for roofing panel requirements

### Step 4.2: Cut and Install Purlines (Modified Length)
- [ ] **Transport accommodation**: Use 16 pieces of 8' 2x4s instead of 8x16'
- [ ] Join purlines at rafter locations with scarf joints
- [ ] Install perpendicular to rafters at marked locations
- [ ] Use 2.5" Torx exterior screws, 2 per rafter
- [ ] Check purlines for straight alignment

## Phase 5: Roofing Installation
**⏱️ Estimated Time: 6-8 hours**

### Step 5.1: Install Underlayment
- [ ] Roll synthetic underlayment starting at eave
- [ ] Overlap seams by 6" minimum
- [ ] Staple every 12" along rafters
- [ ] Extend underlayment 1" beyond fascia

### Step 5.2: Install Drip Edge
- [ ] Install D-style drip edge at eave over underlayment
- [ ] Install L-style trim at ledger under underlayment
- [ ] Overlap joints by 2" minimum
- [ ] Secure with roofing nails every 12"

### Step 5.3: Install Metal Panels
- [ ] Start with full panel at one end
- [ ] Ensure proper overhang (6" at eave, flush at sides)
- [ ] **Use Torx self-drilling screws** in flat areas of panels
- [ ] **DeWalt Impact Driver**: Perfect tool for roofing screws
- [ ] Overlap panels per manufacturer specifications
- [ ] Install closure strips at eave and ridge

### Step 5.4: Final Trim and Sealing
- [ ] Install remaining trim pieces
- [ ] Caulk all penetrations and joints
- [ ] Apply roofing sealant under panel laps
- [ ] Install gutter system if planned

## Quality Control Checkpoints

### During Installation
- [ ] Check measurements twice before cutting
- [ ] Verify square and level at each major step
- [ ] Test fit components before final installation
- [ ] Use proper fasteners for each application

### Final Inspection
- [ ] Walk entire roof perimeter checking for gaps
- [ ] Verify all fasteners are tight and sealed
- [ ] Check drainage flow during first rain
- [ ] Remove all construction debris

## Safety Reminders
- Use fall protection when working above 6 feet
- Have helper for lifting beam and rafters
- Check ladder placement and condition
- Wear safety glasses when cutting or drilling
- Use proper lifting techniques for heavy materials

## Weather Considerations & Time Estimates

### Overall Project Timeline
- **Total Project Time**: 19-26 hours (2-3 full days)
- **Phase 1**: Ledger installation (3-4 hours)
- **Phase 2**: Posts & beam (4-5 hours)  
- **Phase 3**: Rafter installation (4-6 hours)
- **Phase 4**: Purline installation (2-3 hours)
- **Phase 5**: Roofing installation (6-8 hours)

### Weather Requirements

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Ledger Not Level
- Use shims between ledger and wall
- Check wall for bow or irregularities
- Consider scribing ledger to match wall

### Posts Not Plumb (Expected Issue)
- **Common with DIY concrete piers** - plan for this scenario
- Use shims between post bracket and concrete
- Adjust with non-shrink grout if minor variations
- Consider adjustable post bases for significant misalignment
- **String line method**: Use diagonal measurements to square layout
- Ensure adequate temporary bracing during adjustments

### Rafter Fit Issues
- Double-check measurements and calculations
- Verify beam is level and straight
- Adjust bird's mouth cuts as needed

### Panel Installation Problems
- Pre-drill holes to prevent panel distortion
- Use proper closure strips for panel profile
- Don't over-tighten fasteners
