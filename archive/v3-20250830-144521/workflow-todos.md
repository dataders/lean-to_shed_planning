## Key Modifications for User Requirements

### Transport Accommodations
- **Beam**: Changed from 16' to (2) 12' 2x10s for field sistering
- **Ledger**: Changed from 16' to (2) 8' 2x8s with splice plate
- **Purlines**: Changed from (8) 16' to (16) 8' 2x4s for field joining
- **Impact**: Minor cost increase (+$10-16), significant transport convenience

### Torx Fastener Integration
- **Roofing Screws**: Specified self-drilling Torx head (+$5-10)
- **General Fasteners**: Specified Torx exterior screws (+$2-5)
- **Benefit**: Better grip, reduced cam-out, professional appearance

### Tool Assessment & Upgrades
- **Current DeWalt 20V**: All tools adequate except miter saw
- **Priority Upgrade**: 12" sliding compound miter saw ($200-400)
- **Optional**: 7-1/4" cordless circular saw ($150-250)
- **Impact**: Significantly improved cut accuracy and efficiency

### Foundation Status Integration
- ✅ **Concrete piers**: Marked as completed in all documents
- ✅ **Simpson brackets**: Noted as pre-installed
- ⚠️ **Alignment planning**: Procedures added for non-plumb corrections

### Time Estimates Added
- **Phase 1**: Ledger installation (3-4 hours)
- **Phase 2**: Posts & beam (4-5 hours)
- **Phase 3**: Rafter installation (4-6 hours)
- **Phase 4**: Purline installation (2-3 hours)
- **Phase 5**: Roofing installation (6-8 hours)
- **Total**: 19-26 hours (2-3 full days)

## Files Updated with User Considerations
- [x] `user_considerations.md` - New comprehensive constraint documentation ✓ **CREATED**
- [x] `comprehensive-plan.md` - Updated with transport mods, times, tools ✓ **UPDATED**
- [x] `materials-list.md` - Modified for transport, Torx screws, tool advice ✓ **UPDATED**
- [x] `installation-steps.md` - Added times, pier corrections, Torx specs ✓ **UPDATED**
- [x] `workflow-todos.md` - Updated tracking with user modifications ✓ **UPDATED**

## Cost Impact of Modifications
- **Original Estimate**: $669-939
- **Updated Estimate**: $679-955 (+$10-16)
- **Tool Investment**: $350-650 (optional but recommended)
- **Total with Tools**: $1,029-1,605

## Critical Success Factors
