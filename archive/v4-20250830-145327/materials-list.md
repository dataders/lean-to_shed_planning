## Shopping Tips

### Lumber Yard Considerations (Lowe's Preferred)
- Buy lumber in single trip to ensure consistent grade/moisture
- Check for crown/bow in dimensional lumber
- Consider pressure-treated lumber for posts in ground contact
- All lumber sized for 12-foot hatchback transport
- **Beam Strategy**: Purchase (2) 2x10x12' to sister together
- **Ledger Strategy**: Purchase (2) 2x8x8' and join with splice plate

### Hardware Store Strategy (Lowe's/Home Depot)
- **Primary**: Shop Lowe's for all materials when possible
- **Secondary**: Use Home Depot if Lowe's lacks specific items
- **Fastener Preference**: Specify Torx head screws throughout project
- Buy galvanized/stainless fasteners for longevity
- Purchase 10% extra fasteners for waste/mistakes
- Check local building code requirements

### Roofing Supplier Notes
- Order panels 6" longer than calculated (17' for 16.5' need)
- Match existing building colors if desired
- Confirm panel profile compatibility with closure strips
- Ask about cut-to-length services

## Seasonal Considerations
- **Spring/Summer**: Higher material costs, better availability
- **Fall/Winter**: Potential discounts, limited installation weather
- **Bulk Purchases**: Consider combining with other projects

## Tool Investment Considerations

### Current Tool Assessment (20V DeWalt Cordless)
- ✓ **Drill/Driver**: Adequate for project needs
- ✓ **Impact Driver**: Perfect for Torx screws and lag bolts  
- ✓ **Reciprocating Saw**: Good for rough cuts and demo
- ✓ **Oscillating Saw**: Useful for precise trim cuts
- ✓ **Rotary Hammer**: Excellent for concrete work
- ⚠️ **Miter Saw**: Current cheap model may struggle with accuracy

### Recommended Tool Upgrades
- **Priority 1**: 12" Sliding Compound Miter Saw ($200-400)
  - Critical for accurate rafter cuts and complex angles
  - Current saw may lack precision for bird's mouth cuts
- **Priority 2**: Cordless Circular Saw 7-1/4" ($150-250)
  - Alternative to radial saw, more versatile
  - Pairs well with existing DeWalt 20V system

**Tool Investment Total: $350-650** (Significant time savings and accuracy improvement)

## Quality Upgrades
- **Premium Option**: Upgrade to 2x12 beam for extra capacity (+$40)
- **Longevity**: Use stainless steel Torx fasteners (+$60-85)
- **Aesthetics**: Color-matched trim and panels (+$25-50)
- **Insulation**: Add rigid foam under metal (+$75-100)
