# User Considerations & Constraints

**Session Date**: August 30, 2025

This document captures the specific user requirements, constraints, and preferences that must be incorporated into the lean-to roof construction plan.

## Transportation Constraints

- **Vehicle**: Hatchback with 12-foot maximum lumber transport capacity
- **Impact**: All lumber purchases must be ≤12 feet in length or require delivery
- **Solution**: Plan cuts and ordering to accommodate vehicle limitations

## Foundation Status

- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Concrete piers have been dug and poured
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: 4x4 Simpson Strong-Tie hardware installed in piers
- ⚠️ **POTENTIAL ISSUE**: Piers may not be perfectly plumb with one another
- **Accommodation needed**: Plan for pier alignment adjustments during construction

## Hardware Preferences

- **Preferred fasteners**: Torx head screws (all applications where possible)
- **Rationale**: Better grip, reduced cam-out, professional appearance
- **Note**: Specify Torx screws in materials list and installation instructions

## Retail Preferences

- **Primary store**: Lowe's (preferred for materials shopping)
- **Secondary option**: Home Depot (if Lowe's doesn't have required items)
- **Planning impact**: Reference Lowe's product availability in materials list

## Tool Inventory

### Available 20V Cordless DeWalt Tools
- Drill/driver
- Impact driver  
- Reciprocating saw
- Oscillating saw
- Rotary hammer

### Additional Tools
- Miter saw (older, inexpensive model)

### Tool Investment Considerations
- User is willing to purchase upgraded miter saw if current model inadequate
- User is willing to purchase cordless radial saw if needed for efficiency
- **Recommendation needed**: Assess if tool upgrades would significantly improve project

## Planning Requirements

- Include time estimates for all construction phases
- **NEW**: Add amateur-focused time estimates (account for learning curve, mistakes, breaks)
- Account for one-person construction approach
- Consider tool limitations and upgrade recommendations
- Plan material delivery if 12-foot transport limit exceeded
- Include pier leveling/alignment procedures
- Specify Torx fasteners throughout project
- **NEW**: Create structural diagrams showing construction details
- **NEW**: Add executive summary section to comprehensive plan
