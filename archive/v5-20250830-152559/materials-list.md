## Shopping Tips

### Lumber Yard Considerations (Lowe's Preferred)
- Buy lumber in single trip to ensure consistent grade/moisture
- Check for crown/bow in dimensional lumber
- Consider pressure-treated lumber for posts in ground contact
- All lumber sized for 12-foot hatchback transport
- **Beam Strategy**: Purchase (2) 2x10x12' to sister together
- **Ledger Strategy**: Purchase (2) 2x8x8' and join with splice plate

### Hardware Store Strategy (Lowe's/Home Depot)
- **Primary**: Shop Lowe's for all materials when possible
- **Secondary**: Use Home Depot if Lowe's lacks specific items
- **Fastener Preference**: Specify Torx head screws throughout project
- Buy galvanized/stainless fasteners for longevity
- Purchase 10% extra fasteners for waste/mistakes
- Check local building code requirements

### Roofing Supplier Notes
- Order panels 6" longer than calculated (17' for 16.5' need)
- Match existing building colors if desired
- Confirm panel profile compatibility with closure strips
- Ask about cut-to-length services

## Seasonal Considerations
- **Spring/Summer**: Higher material costs, better availability
- **Fall/Winter**: Potential discounts, limited installation weather
- **Bulk Purchases**: Consider combining with other projects

## üö® CRITICAL: Tool & Equipment Requirements

### Current Tool Assessment (20V DeWalt Cordless)
- ‚úì **Drill/Driver**: Adequate for project needs
- ‚úì **Impact Driver**: Perfect for Torx screws and lag bolts  
- ‚úì **Reciprocating Saw**: Good for rough cuts and demo
- ‚úì **Oscillating Saw**: Useful for precise trim cuts
- ‚úì **Rotary Hammer**: Excellent for concrete work
- ‚ùå **Miter Saw**: **CRITICAL ISSUE** - Current cheap model inadequate for structural accuracy

### REQUIRED Equipment (Not Optional)
- **Professional-Grade Miter Saw**: Rent or buy ($200-400)
  - **Contractor Review**: Cheap saw will cause rafter fitting problems
  - **Accuracy Required**: Bird's mouth cuts must be precise for structural integrity
- **Scaffolding/Work Platform**: Rent ($100-200)
  - **Safety Requirement**: Beam installation at 6.5' height
  - **Helper Safety**: Stable platform essential for multiple workers
- **Laser Level**: Rent or buy ($50-150)
  - **Pier Alignment**: Professional accuracy needed for corrections
  - **Beam Installation**: Critical for proper slope

### Optional but Strongly Recommended
- **Beam Lift/Equipment Dolly**: Rent ($50-100)
  - **120 lb beam**: Two 12' 2x12s are heavy and awkward
- **Professional Chalk Line & String Line Kit**: Buy ($30-50)
  - **Layout Accuracy**: Critical for amateur builders

**Equipment Investment Total: $350-900** (Essential for safety and success)

## Quality Upgrades
- **Premium Option**: Upgrade to 2x12 beam for extra capacity (+$40)
- **Longevity**: Use stainless steel Torx fasteners (+$60-85)
- **Aesthetics**: Color-matched trim and panels (+$25-50)
- **Insulation**: Add rigid foam under metal (+$75-100)
