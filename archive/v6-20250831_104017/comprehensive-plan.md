# Lean-To Roof Construction Project

**Project Dashboard & Documentation Hub**

## Executive Summary

‚ö†Ô∏è **PROFESSIONAL CONTRACTOR REVIEW COMPLETED** - [Critical Issues Identified](professional-contractor-review.md)

**Project**: DIY lean-to roof construction attached to existing shed  
**Timeline**: 50-70 hours (6-8 full days for amateur builder) + 2-6 weeks permitting  
**Budget**: $1,300-2,200 (includes permits, engineering, equipment rental)  
**Coverage**: 104 sq ft weatherproof extension

### üö® **CRITICAL ACTIONS REQUIRED BEFORE CONSTRUCTION**
1. **Beam Upgrade Required**: Must use sistered 2x12s (not 2x10s)
2. **Professional Engineering Review**: Structural calculations must be verified
3. **Building Permits**: Likely required - contact building department
4. **Existing Wall Assessment**: Verify shed can handle structural loads
5. **Proper Equipment**: Rent professional-grade tools for accuracy

### Work Overview
This project involves building a 16' x 6.5' lean-to roof that attaches to your existing shed wall and is supported by three concrete piers (already completed). The structure uses **side-sistered 2x12 beams** (rafters sandwiched between beam halves), 2x6 rafters at 24" spacing, and corrugated steel roofing.

### üîÑ **DESIGN UPDATE**: Side-Sistered Beam Configuration
- **Stronger connection**: Rafters maintain full structural depth (no bird's mouth notching)
- **Easier assembly**: No precision rafter cuts required
- **Better alignment**: Self-aligning during installation
- **Amateur-friendly**: Eliminates most difficult aspect of rafter installation

### Critical Success Factors
- **Tool upgrade recommended**: Current miter saw may lack precision for rafter cuts
- **Helper required**: Beam installation needs 2+ people
- **Weather dependent**: Allow 4-5 consecutive good weather days
- **Pier alignment**: Plan for correction procedures (piers may not be perfectly plumb)

### Pre-Completed Work ‚úÖ
- Concrete pier excavation and pouring
- Simpson Strong-Tie bracket installation
- Permit acquisition (if required)

## üèóÔ∏è Construction Timeline

### Amateur Builder Timeline (With Learning Curve)
**Total Project Time**: 30-40 hours (4-5 full days)

| Phase | Description | Time | Key Tasks |
|-------|-------------|------|-----------|
| **Phase 1** | [Ledger Installation](installation-steps.md#phase-1-ledger-board-installation) | 5-7 hrs | Wall attachment, flashing, hangers |
| **Phase 2** | [Posts & Beam](installation-steps.md#phase-2-post-and-beam-assembly) | 6-8 hrs | Pier corrections, beam sistering |
| **Phase 3** | [Rafter Installation](installation-steps.md#phase-3-rafter-installation) | 6-8 hrs | **Side-sistered assembly (no bird's mouth)** |
| **Phase 4** | [Purline Installation](installation-steps.md#phase-4-purline-installation) | 3-4 hrs | Roofing substrate preparation |
| **Phase 5** | [Metal Roofing](installation-steps.md#phase-5-roofing-installation) | 8-11 hrs | Panel installation, weatherproofing |

### Amateur Time Factors
- **Learning curve**: First-time techniques add 30-70% time
- **Mistake correction**: Budget 10-15% extra time for redoing steps
- **Tool familiarity**: Unfamiliar tools slow initial progress
- **Measurement verification**: Triple-checking prevents costly errors
