## Key Modifications for User Requirements

### Transport Accommodations
- **Beam**: Changed from 16' to (2) 12' 2x10s for field sistering
- **Ledger**: Changed from 16' to (2) 8' 2x8s with splice plate
- **Purlines**: Changed from (8) 16' to (16) 8' 2x4s for field joining
- **Impact**: Minor cost increase (+$10-16), significant transport convenience

### Torx Fastener Integration
- **Roofing Screws**: Specified self-drilling Torx head (+$5-10)
- **General Fasteners**: Specified Torx exterior screws (+$2-5)
- **Benefit**: Better grip, reduced cam-out, professional appearance

### Tool Assessment & Upgrades
- **Current DeWalt 20V**: All tools adequate except miter saw
- **Priority Upgrade**: 12" sliding compound miter saw ($200-400)
- **Optional**: 7-1/4" cordless circular saw ($150-250)
- **Impact**: Significantly improved cut accuracy and efficiency

### Foundation Status Integration
- ✅ **Concrete piers**: Marked as completed in all documents
- ✅ **Simpson brackets**: Noted as pre-installed
- ⚠️ **Alignment planning**: Procedures added for non-plumb corrections

### Time Estimates Added (Amateur Builder Focus)
- **Phase 1**: Ledger installation (5-7 hours) [+60% for measuring/leveling]
- **Phase 2**: Posts & beam (6-8 hours) [+50% for alignment corrections]
- **Phase 3**: Rafter installation (8-10 hours) [+70% for cutting precision]
- **Phase 4**: Purline installation (3-4 hours) [+30% for spacing accuracy]
- **Phase 5**: Roofing installation (8-11 hours) [+40% for panel installation]
- **Total**: 30-40 hours (4-5 full days with learning curve)
