- the ledger board height will be about 7.5 above the ground
- the roof will be a single slope
- the roof will be 16 feet long
- distance between the shed and the posts will be about 6 feet
- i've already made concrete piers for the posts with 4x4 simpson strong ties
- there are 3 piers spaced 8 feet apart
