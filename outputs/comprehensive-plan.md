# Lean-To Roof Construction Plan

## Project Overview
Building a 16' long lean-to roof attached to an existing shed with corrugated steel roofing, 2:12 pitch, and 6.5' horizontal run.

## Key Specifications
- **Roof Length**: 16 feet
- **Run (horizontal projection)**: 6.5 feet  
- **Pitch**: 2:12 (2" rise per 12" run)
- **Ledger Height**: 7.5 feet above ground
- **Overhang**: 6" past beam, no side overhangs
- **Rafter Spacing**: 24" on center (9 rafters total)
- **Support**: 3 posts at 8' spacing on concrete piers

## Structural Calculations

### Rafter Calculations
- **Run**: 6.5 feet = 78 inches
- **Rise**: 78" × (2/12) = 13 inches
- **Rafter Length**: √(78² + 13²) = √(6084 + 169) = √6253 = 79.08" = 6.59 feet
- **Total Rafter Length** (with overhangs): 6.59' + 0.5' = 7.09' → **8' 2x6 rafters**

### Beam Sizing
For 16' span with rafters 24" OC supporting corrugated steel:
- **Recommended**: 2x10 or 2x12 beam
- **Dead Load**: ~15 psf (roofing + framing)
- **Live Load**: 20 psf minimum
- **Snow Load**: Check local requirements

### Height Calculations
- **Ledger Height**: 7.5 feet
- **Beam Height**: 7.5' - 13" = 6.42 feet above ground
- **Post Height**: 6.42' + beam thickness = ~6.5' above concrete

## Materials List

### Lumber
- **Rafters**: 9 pieces 2x6x8'
- **Beam**: 2 pieces 2x10x16' or 1 piece 4x10x16'
- **Ledger Board**: 1 piece 2x8x16' (or 2x10 to match beam)
- **Purlines**: 8 pieces 2x4x16'
- **Posts**: 3 pieces 4x4x8'

### Hardware
- **Rafter Hangers**: 9 pieces 2x6 joist hangers
- **Ledger Bolts**: 1/2" x 6" lag bolts, 16" OC
- **Post Brackets**: Simpson Strong-Tie connectors for 4x4 posts
- **Galv. Nails/Screws**: For hangers and general framing
- **Carriage Bolts**: 1/2" x 8" for beam-to-post connections

### Roofing Materials  
- **Steel Panels**: Corrugated steel, 16' length + 6" overhang = 17' panels
- **Ridge/Eave Trim**: L-style at ledger, D-style at eave
- **Underlayment**: Synthetic roofing underlayment, 200 sq ft
- **Fasteners**: Self-drilling screws for steel roofing
- **Sealants/Caulk**: For weather sealing

## Installation Sequence

### Phase 1: Ledger Installation
1. Mark ledger location on shed wall at 7.5' height
2. Locate wall studs and mark bolt locations 16" OC
3. Drill pilot holes and install 1/2" lag bolts
4. Install flashing above ledger board
5. Attach rafter hangers to ledger, 24" OC

### Phase 2: Post and Beam Installation  
1. Cut 4x4 posts to final height (measure from concrete)
2. Attach posts to concrete piers with Simpson brackets
3. Set beam on posts and check for level
4. Secure beam to posts with carriage bolts
5. Install post bracing if required

### Phase 3: Rafter Installation
1. Cut bird's mouth notches in rafters (1.5" x 3.5" for 2x beam)
2. Test fit first rafter and use as template
3. Install rafters in hangers at ledger
4. Secure rafters to beam with approved connections
5. Install blocking between rafters if required

### Phase 4: Purline Installation
1. Mark purline locations 24" OC across rafters
2. Install 2x4 purlines perpendicular to rafters
3. Use galvanized nails or screws for attachment
4. Check spacing for roofing panel layout

### Phase 5: Roofing Installation
1. Install synthetic underlayment starting at eave
2. Install D-style drip edge at eave
3. Install corrugated steel panels from bottom up
4. Overlap panels per manufacturer specs
5. Install L-style trim at ledger connection
6. Seal all penetrations and joints

## Critical Notes
- **Building Permits**: Check local requirements before starting
- **Attachment Method**: Verify shed wall can support ledger loads
- **Flashing**: Proper flashing at ledger is critical for water protection
- **Post Foundation**: Ensure piers are below frost line
- **Beam Size**: Confirm beam sizing with local building codes

## Tools Required
- Circular saw or miter saw
- Drill/driver and bits  
- Level (4' minimum)
- Tape measure
- Speed square
- Chalk line
- Hammer
- Socket wrenches
- Safety equipment (glasses, gloves, fall protection)

## Safety Considerations
- Use proper fall protection when working at height
- Check electrical lines before cutting or drilling
- Ensure adequate temporary bracing during construction
- Follow manufacturer instructions for all hardware
