# Lean-To Roof Construction Workflow Todos

**Session Start**: 2025-08-30 14:11:01
**Project**: DIY Lean-To Roof attached to existing shed

## Construction Planning Todos

### Phase 1: Design & Planning
- [x] Calculate exact rafter lengths and cuts ✓ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Determine beam size and span requirements ✓ **COMPLETED** 
- [x] Create detailed materials list with quantities ✓ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Design ledger board attachment method ✓ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Plan electrical/gutter considerations ✓ **COMPLETED**

### Phase 2: Structural Components
- [x] Size and specify the beam (2x10 or 2x12) ✓ **COMPLETED** - Recommend sistered 2x10s
- [x] Calculate rafter bird's mouth cuts ✓ **COMPLETED** - 1.5" x 3.5"
- [x] Specify hardware requirements (hangers, bolts, etc.) ✓ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Plan post-to-beam connections ✓ **COMPLETED**

### Phase 3: Installation Steps
- [x] Create step-by-step installation sequence ✓ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Detail ledger board installation ✓ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Plan rafter installation process ✓ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Specify roofing installation steps ✓ **COMPLETED**

### Phase 4: Materials & Tools
- [x] Complete lumber list with dimensions ✓ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Hardware and fastener specifications ✓ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Tool requirements list ✓ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Safety equipment needed ✓ **COMPLETED**

### Phase 5: Code Compliance
- [x] Check local building code requirements ✓ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Snow load calculations if applicable ✓ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Attachment requirements to existing structure ✓ **COMPLETED**

## Issues Identified
- ~~Current spec.md is just raw requirements, needs comprehensive planning~~ ✓ **RESOLVED**
- ~~Need to calculate actual rafter lengths with bird's mouth cuts~~ ✓ **RESOLVED**
- ~~Missing beam sizing calculations~~ ✓ **RESOLVED**
- ~~No installation sequence provided~~ ✓ **RESOLVED**

## Files Created/Updated
- [x] `comprehensive-plan.md` - Main construction plan ✓ **COMPLETED**
- [x] `materials-list.md` - Complete materials and quantities ✓ **COMPLETED**
- [x] `installation-steps.md` - Step-by-step instructions ✓ **COMPLETED**
- [x] `calculations.md` - Structural calculations and sizing ✓ **COMPLETED**

## Key Accomplishments
- **Structural Analysis**: Completed full engineering calculations showing sistered 2x10 beam required
- **Cost Estimation**: Detailed materials list with $669-$939 total project cost
- **Installation Plan**: Comprehensive 5-phase installation sequence with safety protocols
- **Code Compliance**: Verified all structural requirements and deflection limits
